# Niyantri Cafe - Hyderabadi Coffee Website

This project contains a simple, multi-page coffee shop website for Niyantri Cafe, located in Hyderabad, India. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes a mock PayPal checkout flow, a static five-page structure, and a small client-side cart implemented with localStorage.

Pages:
- index.html: Home / Hero with call-to-action and testimonials
- menu.html: Menu items with Add to Cart actions
- cart.html: Cart with a mock PayPal checkout flow
- about.html: About the cafe and its values
- contact.html: Contact form with mock submission

Notes and conventions:
- Location placeholder: Hyderabad, India
- All content is static for this mockup; the cart uses localStorage to simulate a real cart.
- Font loading: The pages include a placeholder comment for fonts and actual font links to Playfair Display (serif) and Inter (sans).
- Footer copyright year uses 2025 as per provided current year.

How to run:
- Open index.html in a browser. All pages link via relative paths (./menu.html, ./cart.html, etc.).
- The theme is a warm, welcoming design by default.
